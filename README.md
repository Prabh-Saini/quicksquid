# QuickSquid
Quick Squid quickly creates a Squid proxy with NO authentication, on the DEFAULT port (3128). Do not use this script for anything important, if you do make sure to change the default port and IP authenticate your proxy. 
## Supported OS
Supports Ubuntu 20.04, other OS's may not work with this script as they have not been checked.
